What does Order Submission Rejected mean?\n\n• The order service rejects order submissions for the following reasons\n\n• Payment authorization fails\n\n• Loyalty authorization fails\n\n• CustomerCart call fails\n\n• Saving Order to Database fails.\n\n• When this happens, orders are not created in Byte Commerce.\n\n\n----\n### 3.

A downgrade to priority 3 was made due to no significant business impact, and small bursts of retries are being monitored. PH determined this was due to a new logging pattern they introduced in which they caught existing issues when events started.","status":"closed","call_url":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_Mzk1ZDI3ZjgtMzQwZC00ZDVkLTllZGMtN2NjY2MxMGQ4MGQ0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%222ba9001d-d7f9-43a3-a098-6a927ac715ca%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22405a50ca-57aa-41c2-9067-c5f74f6ed465%22%7d","slack_team_id":"TQ2NDCGAU","slack_channel_id":"C0961G9R9P0","slack_channel_name":"07-16-closed-p3-inc7438-switchboard-event-dispatch-failure-for-pizza-hut-us","created_at":"2025-07-16T19:06:39.44Z","updated_at":"2025-07-17T21:20:33.567Z","timestamps":[{"name":"reported","last_occurred_at":"2025-07-16T19:06:39.44Z"},{"name":"accepted"},{"name":"identified"},{"name":"fixed"},{"name":"closed","last_occurred_at":"2025-07-17T21:20:33.433Z"},{"name":"declined"},{"name":"last_activity","last_occurred_at":"2025-07-17T21:20:22.737Z"}],"mode":"real","visibility":"public","severity":{"created_at":"2024-11-14T17:29:49.691Z","updated_at":"2025-02-24T15:46:39.015Z","id":"01JCNVJRBEKQDKCYKQRA11V9RD","name":"P3","description":"Issues with low impact, which can usually be handled within working hours.
